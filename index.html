    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my website! On this page you'll find information about my
      background, interests, and hobbies.
    </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I am a first-year ITM student with a passion for cybersecurity, data
      analytics, and software development. In the future I plan to go more in
      depth on AI, but as of right now I want to build a strong foundation in
      programming and systems design.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I have a wide range of interests, but some of my main ones include
      technology, music, and travel. I am particularly interested in the
      intersection of technology and society, and how we can use technology to
      solve real-world problems. I also enjoy listening to music and attending
      concerts, as well as traveling to new places and experiencing different
      cultures.
    </p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy exploring new places whether in the city or
      around the world in general. I also enjoy playing and watching sports. I
      also recently got into photography and fashion, so I am trying to focus
      more of my free time on these activities. My favorite sports are football and basketball. I enjoy playing basketball more than football, but I enjoy watching both sports. I also enjoy going to the gym and staying active. I find that physical activity helps me to clear my mind and stay focused on my goals.

  <h2> Favorite Foods</h2> 
    <p>
      I have a diverse palate and enjoy trying new foods from different
      cultures. Some of my favorite dishes include burgers, sushi, pasta, steak, and butter chicken. I also enjoy trying new desserts and sweets, such as ice cream, cake, and cookies. I am always open to trying new foods and expanding my culinary horizons. I also enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I find it rewarding to create delicious meals and share them with friends and family. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, I am a curious and adventurous person who enjoys exploring new ideas and experiences. I am excited to see where my interests and hobbies will take me in the future, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. I will continue to pursue my passions and strive to make a positive impact in the world through my work and my actions. I will always tackle the opportunities and challenges that come my way with enthusiasm and determination.
