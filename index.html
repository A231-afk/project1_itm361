    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my website! On this page you'll find information about my
      background, interests, and hobbies.
    </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I am a first-year ITM student with a passion for cybersecurity, data
      analytics, and software development. In the future I plan to go more in
      depth on AI, but as of right now I want to build a strong foundation in
      programming and systems design.
    </p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I have a wide range of interests, but some of my main ones include
      technology, music, and travel. I am particularly interested in the
      intersection of technology and society, and how we can use technology to
      solve real-world problems. I also enjoy listening to music and attending
      concerts, as well as traveling to new places and experiencing different
      cultures.
    </p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy exploring new places whether in the city or
      around the world in general. I also enjoy playing and watching sports. I
      also recently got into photography and fashion, so I am trying to focus
      more of my free time on these activities.
